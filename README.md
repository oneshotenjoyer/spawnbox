# SpawnBox

A (decently) simple game framework based on pysdl2 and [MandawEngineSDL.](https://github.com/mandaw2014/MandawEngineSDL)

Documentation is on [gitbook.io](https://modguy07.gitbook.io/spawnbox).

Really quick side note: Version 1.0.0 took me about 15 minutes to push to GitHub and pypi because my power went out briefly, turning off my WiFi, and causing my monitor to flicker off.
